                            <p class="portfolio-content">To maintain design quality, every change had to be approved at the product level. This meant that even the smallest tasks required Designers to sit for internal review followed by a product review which happen on fixed days of the week. After discussing it with my Design Manager, we agreed that new methods could skip this step if the UI is made more consistent.</p>

The current implementation of the payment screens also had quite a few legacy bugs that needed to be addressed.</p>

                            <p class="portfolio-content">Most importantly, my PM wanted to be able to launch the new payment method on time. This gave me less than a week in total to deliver so I had to manage my time effectively.</p>

                            <p class="portfolio-content">Familiarity is key as users may already have set expectations about how online payment works. In the interest of time, I focused on gathering references from major region-specific e-commerce and gaming platforms, like Shopee and Codashop. This helped inform Call-to-Action (CTA) choices, such as in cases where there were up to 3 possible CTAs.</p>

                            <p class="portfolio-content">Since screenshot activity could not be tracked on the web, my Data Analyst and I extrapolated user behaviour from the click-through-rate on the 'Download QR code' button. Analysis of successful payments showed that 10% of users clicked download while 90% completed without interaction, leading us to conclude that screenshots are the dominant method, though there is still some reliance on downloads. After some consideration, we decided to retain the download call-to-action for less tech-savvy users.</p>

                            <p class="portfolio-content">Several tradeoffs were necessary during the design process. The back button had been previously removed to reduce drop-offs. To maintain consistency across the platform, I added the navbar back with the status placed the title. <br><br>To help users confirm the selected method before payment and build trust, I also added the method name and logo for familiarity. However, the Content team required the method name to appear in the navbar's title so the positions had to be swapped.</p>

However, when I reviewed the design internally, I received a question asking if there's two steps to the payment.</p>

                            <p class="portfolio-content">This project cut development turnaround time by up to a week and reduced administrative design work. Engineers could start implementing new payment methods without waiting for the final sign-off.</p>
                            <p class="portfolio-content">It also revealed the inefficiency in our structured approval process. What was originally meant to safeguard quality had become a bottleneck. Even simple tasks like adding a payment method required formal documentation and full reviews. The administrative overhead felt especially taxing when we were neck-deep in projects.</p>
                            <p class="portfolio-content">Additionally, post-development activities like acceptance testing have never been tracked in design time estimates, resulting in bugs and UI issues across all existing payment methods in production. This prompted Design Managers to reassess the process of approvals and estimations for business-as-usual (BAU) work.</p>

                            <p class="portfolio-content">Due to the limited timeframe I was working with and the revenue risk associated with any payment-related redesign, I opted for UI that users were more familiar with to play it safe.</p>
                            <p class="portfolio-content">With additional time, I would have liked to experiment on changes in a more methodological manner and challenge existing assumptions. For example, running A/B tests to compare the impact of offering one or multiple call-to-actions and also the prominence of the expiry time and other actions.</p>
